/**
 * Provides an edge-reversed view g' of a directed graph g. The vertex sets for the two graphs are the same, but g' contains an edge (v2, v1) iff g contains an
 * edge (v1, v2). g' is backed by g, so changes to g are reflected in g', and vice versa.

 * <p>
 * This class allows you to use a directed graph algorithm in reverse. For example, suppose you have a directed graph representing a tree, with edges from
 * parent to child, and you want to find all of the parents of a node. To do this, simply create an edge-reversed graph and pass that as input to
 * {@link org.jgrapht.traverse.DepthFirstIterator}.
