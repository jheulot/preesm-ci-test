 * Set of methods to help developers locate, load or read resources from the Preesm source code (or binary) base. This
 * is useful for loading templates, test inputs, default scripts, etc. This helper is not intended to be used for
 * writing files. Entry point is the {@link #resolve(String, List, Object)} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The resolved resources have to be located under the '&lt;project&gt;/resources/' folder, and the full path under this
 * folder is required. This path is defined as constant (see {@link #RESOURCE_PATH}) and as project setting in the
 * parent pom.xml file. In order for the resources to be retrievable from an exported Eclipse plug-in, the
 * '&lt;project&gt;/resources/' must be included in the 'bin.includes' section of the 'build.properties' file.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A sample call would look like
 *
 * <pre>
 * final URL url = PreesmResourcesHelper.getInstance().resolve("GanttHelp.html", "org.preesm.algorithm",
 *     GanttPlotter.class);
 * final String content = PreesmResourcesHelper.getInstance().read(url);
 * </pre>
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * To find helper methods for input/output (algorithm, generated code, etc.), see {@link PreesmIOHelper}.
