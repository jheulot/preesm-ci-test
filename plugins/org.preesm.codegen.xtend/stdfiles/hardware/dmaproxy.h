 * DMA proxy kernel module
 * 
 * Author   : Alfonso Rodriguez <alfonso.rodriguezm@upm.es>
 * Date     : July 2017
 * 
 * Features :
 *     - Platform driver + character device
 *     - Targets memcpy operations (requires src and dst addresses)
 *     - Relies on Device Tree (Open Firmware) to get DMA engine info
 *     - mmap()  : provides zero-copy memory allocation (direct access
 *                 from user-space virtual memory to physical memory)
 *     - ioctl() : enables command passing between user-space and
 *                 character device (e.g. to start DMA transfers)
 *
