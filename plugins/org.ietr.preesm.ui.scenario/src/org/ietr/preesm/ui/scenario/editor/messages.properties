Constraints.coreSelectionTooltip=Select the operator to edit its constraints
Constraints.description=The constraints precise which task can be executed on the given operator.
RelativeConstraints.constraintColumn=group ID
RelativeConstraints.description=The relative constraints can associate each actor to a group given by a number. All instances of actors of a given group are mapped on the same operator. -1 means that no group is selected. Associating one actor alone to a group ensures that all its occurences share a same processor.

Simulation.title=Simulation
Simulation.mainOperator.title=Main operator selection
Simulation.mainOperator.description=Select the operator that will be used as main operator. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation\: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of operators with the same type as the main operator. The mapping will be better if the main operator is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.
Simulation.mainOperatorSelectionTooltip=Select the main operator
Simulation.mainMedium.title=Main ComNode selection
Simulation.mainMedium.description=Select the ComNode that will be used as main ComNode. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation\: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of operators totally connected by media with the type selected here. The mapping will be better if the main ComNode is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.

Simulation.SpecialVertex.description=Be careful\: a broadcasts/explode/implode can only be mapped on either its predecessors operators or its successors operators. Do not reduce excessively the operator capabilities to broadcasts/explode/implode or errors will appear during mapping. Selecting no operator to execute broadcasts/implode/explode actually selects them all.
